# Lesson 4: Machine Learning with Python

In this lesson, we will:

* install the [ImageAI](https://imageai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) image recognition package
* apply computer vision process on random photos
* explore the results and brainstorm

## TO The Cloud

Let's write a script to:

1. run prediction on random image files
2. upload the image to Box
3. write the predictions as metadata

We can download zip of random images at [Unsample](http://unsample.net).
Unsample is powered by the most excellent [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

## ImageAI

> Built with simplicity in mind, ImageAI supports a list of state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms for image prediction, custom image prediction, object detection, video detection, video object tracking and image predictions trainings.

To install ImageAI:

```bash

python3 -m pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python
python3 -m pip install imageai

```

## Brainstorm

> cloud storage API + machine learning = endless possibilities

Python libraries are available for every use case. With Python and a cloud storage API, we can script managing our files securely and add metadata generated by any Python package.
