# Automating Cloud Content Management and Processing with Box and Python

by Isaac J. Galvan

## Workshop Description

Don't let your cloud data storage be out of reach! With over a terabyte uploaded daily, U of I Box is easy to upload to, but difficult to master. In this workshop, you'll learn to manage files in Box using the Python SDK. We'll write scripts to enforce naming conventions, automate document workflows, and analyze files with image recognition algorithms to write predictions as metadata to Box.

**Learning Outcome:** Participants will learn how to run and develop Python applications and to interact programmatically with data stored in Box.

## Session Prerequistes

There are a few things you’ll need to have for this workshop to be a success:

* Your laptop computer.
  * Please be charged and ready to go. I imagine there will be power outlets available, but I don’t know for sure.
* **IMPORTANT: Sign up for a Box Developer account using a personal email address not associated with your @illinois.edu identity.**
  * This ensures you don’t accidentally expose or change your important work files.
  * [Sign up for Box Developer Account](https://box.com/developer_signup)
* Install a recent version of Python 3. See the links below for guidance.
  * **IMPORTANT: Install Python version 3.7.5.** A library we’ll be using in not yet compatible with Python 3.8.
  * [Download Python 3.7.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/)
  * Some operating systems coming with Python 2 installed. Please verify Python 3 is available on your system.
* An IDE, text editor, or other code editor
  * I will be using Visual Studio Code with the Python extension.
